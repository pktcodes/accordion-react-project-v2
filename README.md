#### Accordion consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a

- Tabbed interface with a list of **questions** and **answers** stacked vertically.
- Each **Question** can be expanded or collapsed to reveal the content associated with that item on the click of buttons i.e., âž• to show and âž– to hide.
- Data is handled by the `data.js` file.
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm run dev` to start up the development server on default port 5173.
